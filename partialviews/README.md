# this is the partial views
This code utilises the PCL library to create a dataset of vfh signatures from a cad file in .ply format

# How to run 
to first build and run make a build directory within the partialviews folder \n
mkdir build
cd build
once in build folder invoke cmake and make 
cmake ..
make
Once these commands have been completed the project should be succesfully if you have the proper dependecies installed i.e. pcl 11.3
